        So, we all post comments on social media, sometimes we even get in heated debates about things we do know and also things we don’t. Now, what happens when you still want to air some heat, but don’t want to be tied to that explosive wall of text by accounts, emails, or anything traceable back to you. Say, your employer, coworker, etc. could use a good ‘comment’ in the rear from an anonymous source? That’s where my website comes in. “Say-it!” it’s a place where anyone can air their frustrations, no strings attached. Share your comment through its URL or leave it on the cloud for any other person to see it. No replies, or even comment threads discussing why you are in the wrong, just you letting off some steam. It’s therapeutic! Anyone can see read or share it, no one is the wiser. Want to give it a go?
There are lots of things that can boil your beans today, huh?
How about Saying it to their faces. On the internet, there is not such thing as “screaming to the void”, because “Rage finds a way!” Who knows, maybe your “special” someone will read this passionate wall of text on of these days.

      <h3>My Tab</h3>
      <p>
        Hey there fellow Sayer! Welcome to your tab. Here is where you can manage your presets on the messages you leave. Remember this is tied to your cache only, since you are not required to make an account. So, you can create some presets like colors, text size, fonts, and even link an image from another website, so you can use it as a footer or whatever your imagination tells you.
Keep in mind that we don’t store the resources directly in our website. Everything is used via links. If an element you used gets taken down from its source page, it will not longer appear here. Also, changes you make on your tab are client based, the sever won’t save anything on our side.
I wish we could do more, but we would have to make an offering to the internet gods first. Either that or force you to create an account, which then will surely be hacked and your secret message for your boss, will no longer be so secret. Maybe once technology advances, or you learn to keep your passwords secure and not use “Steve123” as your main choice of secret keywords.
Remember: We don’t condone the use of graphic material and or other harmful elements (we will call the cops on you if you post something illegal). You can always vent your frustration through the power of words! And sometimes, an image can help your point get across, but nothing says “I can’t stand your crap” like SAYING IT yourself! Have fun and rage one Sayer!
