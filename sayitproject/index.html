                <p class="hero-msg">So, we all post comments on social media, sometimes we even get in heated debates about things we do know and also things we don’t. Now, what happens when you still want to air some heat, but don’t want to be tied to that explosive wall of text by accounts, emails, or anything traceable back to you. Say, your employer, coworker, etc. could use a good ‘comment’ in the rear from an anonymous source? That’s where my website comes in. “Say-it!” it’s a place where anyone can air their frustrations, no strings attached. Share your comment through its URL or leave it on the cloud for any other person to see it. No replies, or even comment threads discussing why you are in the wrong, just you letting off some steam. It’s therapeutic! Anyone can see read or share it, no one is the wiser. Want to give it a go?
                    There are lots of things that can boil your beans today, huh?
                    How about Saying it to their faces. On the internet, there is not such thing as “screaming to the void”, because “Rage finds a way!” Who knows, maybe your “special” someone will read this passionate wall of text on of these days.
