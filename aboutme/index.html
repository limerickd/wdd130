        <p>Hello there!

        I'm Erick Puma, 36 years old. I'm from Ecuador, South America. I'm an English Teacher. My wife is still in college and has participated in multiple beauty contests, she is very loving and caring and I just love her to the moon and back!</p>
        <p>We are currently waiting for our first child. We're excited but scared at the same time, but I guess no one is ready to be a parent, and we just learn as we go. Or so they say.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, our son is a great blessing in our life already. And we are so happy to be able to grow our family together.</p>
        <p>Looking forward to work with you all this semester</p>
